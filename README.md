# SampleWork
I'm passionate about math, data science, and applying them to solve real-world problems. During my experience as a Math and Data Scientist Enthusiast at a Fortune 50 company, I worked on diverse projects in weather forecasting and assortment optimization within the Merchandising department. Through these projects, I honed my coding skills and gained valuable insights into applying data science in a business setting.

This showcase highlights my coding style, key Learnings, and select projects. While replicating all projects on your local machine might not be feasible, I hope it conveys my dedication and expertise in the field.
